br Bulk Rename
br is a simple command-line utility written in C that allows you to rename multiple files and directories eficiently. It opens a list of files in your preferred text editor, enabling you to modify the names as you see fit. After editing, br renames the files according to your modifications.

Usage
To use br, run the executable from the command line. If no arguments are provided, VimV will list files and directories in the current directory. If you provide file or directory names as arguments, VimV will use them instead.

./vimv [file1] [file2] ...
If you run br without any arguments, it will operate on all regular files and directories in the current directory.

How it Works
Listing Files: br first lists the files and directories either from the command-line arguments or from the current directory.

Editing in Vim: The file names are written to a temporary file, which is then opened in your preferred text editor (default is Vim). You can modify the names directly in the editor.

Renaming Files: After editing, VimV reads the modified file names and renames the corresponding files and directories.

Changing default Editor:
br relies on $EDITOR 

Example
$ ./br file1.txt file2.txt
This command will open file1.txt and file2.txt in your text editor. After making changes and saving the file, VimV will rename the files accordingly.

Notes
br skips files with names '.' and '..', as these represent the current and parent directories.
If a destination file already exists, br will skip renaming that particular file and proceed with the next one.
Error messages will be displayed if any issues occur during the process.
Dependencies
br relies on standard C libraries and system calls. No external libraries are used.

Build
./c 
./c install
./c remove
