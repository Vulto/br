NAME
       br - Bulk Rename Files and Directories

SYNOPSIS
       br [SOURCE ...]

DESCRIPTION
       br is a command-line utility for bulk renaming files and directories.
       It allows you to rename multiple files and directories simultaneously
       by opening a temporary file with a list of filenames in a text editor.
       After editing the filenames, br will rename the corresponding files
       and directories based on the modifications made in the editor.

OPTIONS
       None.

ARGUMENTS
       SOURCE

              no source is provided, br will read files and directories from
              the current working directory.

       3. Rename files and directories using a custom text editor:
          $ EDITOR=nano br

EXIT STATUS
